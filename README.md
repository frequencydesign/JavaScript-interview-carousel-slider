## JavaScript Interview Code Test / Code Challenge 

###Pure JavaScript Carousel/Slider with Accordion Previewer from 2013 Interview
A copy of a pure JavaScript carousel which I was asked to do in 4 hours at an interview in 2013. I'm posting it to share and to give anyone something to practice before an interview.

I wrote the CSS, the JavaScript (no frameworks) and the HTML. I only switched out names and images to conceal the companies identity.

###The Interview Conditions
The interview was pretty straight forward. Three 30 minute 2-person panel interviews and one 20 minute VP of Technology interview, followed by a programming test. Build a carousel using the assets and instructions given.

You have 4 hours to complete this. Here's a computer with a basic text editor and internet.

Good luck.

###My Result - I got the offer
I finished on-time. Later that week, I got the offer.

I ultimately passed on the position because the offer and the responsibility could not stand-up to my current position.

They mentioned bonus points for having made a sprite of the navigation assets, making clear comments (in the interview!), and for making it mobile friendly (adaptive).
